Check SMS messages from a Google Voice account to control the lightshow

When executed, this script will check all the SMS messages from a Google Voice account checking for
either the "help" command, which will cause a help message to be sent back to the original sender,
or a single number indicating which song they are voting for.

When a song is voted for, the playlist file will be updated with the sender's cell phone number to
indicate it has received a vote from that caller.  This also enforces only a single vote per phone
number per s (until that song is played).

See the commands.py file for other commands that are also supported (as well as instructions on
adding new own commands).

Sample usage:

sudo check_sms.py --playlist=/home/pi/music/.playlist

Third party dependencies:

pygooglevoice: http://sphinxdoc.github.io/pygooglevoice/
Beautiful Soup: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Note, I had to use the following version of pygooglevoice w/auth fix:
